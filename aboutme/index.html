    <h2>Omar Andrews Loku</h2>
    <p>Hi!</p>
    <p> My name is Omar. I am a Ghanaian and currently live in Ghana; a town called AKOSOMBO in the Eastern region of Ghana. I am the last born from a family of five.</p>
    <p>Currently I serve as an Auditor in the Kpong Ghana District, a calling I have held since I returned from mission in 2016. I am single and ready to mingle.</p>
    <p>I love to play Video games and Piano at my leisure time and love computers so much, hence my choice to study Applied Tech.</p>
    <p>Though I am yet to decide on the area of specialty, I am certain I will figure that out before the end of this semester.
        I am very open and always happy to make new friends all over the globe.</p>
