        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>To have an online site where all the activites organized by the single adults, 
            all upcoming activites and various important informaton for the LDS Kpong Ghana district
         is stored. This site is needed to hold the history of events in the district so they are kept
         kept for Eternity for the world to see and know what's going on in Kpong</p>
    
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>The target is all LDS members across the globe especially (those aged 18+ and single). 
            These are people who will be looking for ways to mingle and make commitments to 
            a partner for Eternity. They have limited access to members in other parts of the world
            and this will help bridge the gap. The site will be accessible with a desktop, laptop 
            and mobile phones.
