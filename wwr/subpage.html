            <img class="past-img" src="images/gp1.jpg" alt="events already held">
            <p>Young single adults and their friends love to gather and participate in wholesome activities and experiences that bring them closer to one another and to God.
                The Gathering place is one program that has made that possible. A gathering place is a designated location (in an existing meetinghouse or institute building) for young single adults and their friends to gather and participate in one or more activities such as; Religious education and gospel learning, Service and social activities, and Self-reliance and educational opportunities.
                The YSA Planned a jogging exercise, after the jogging, they gathered at the district center to clean and then spent the rest of time doing aerobics and having fun.
                It was so a memorable experince for all the joy of that day still linger in out hearts and minds till this day.

                <img class="upcoming-img" src="images/upcoming.png" alt="events coming up">
                <p>As part of the gospel and not making things so boring for the younger groups, occasionally; trips are organized in the form of excursions for the YSA to travel and have fun by visiting tourist sites and sceneries. 
                    This puts the YSA in the spirit of unity as the saying goes; â€œFriends that travel together, stay together.
                    This time, there is going to be an excurcion to Kakum National Park in the Central region of Ghana. Central region holds almost all the historic memories about our mother land Ghana.
                    It is commonly known as the point for trading slaves in the then, Gold Coast; now Ghana. It will be a delight for us to have 
                    our institute in the Castle where our forefathers were held prisoners before being sold out as slaves. There is also a canopy 
                    walk which we will visit after the castle to have lots of fun.
