        <p> A gathering place for young single adults (YSAs) is a designated location (in an existing meetinghouse or institute building) for YSAs and their friends to gather and participate in wholesome activities and experiences that will bring them closer to one another and to God. To get started, Identify buildings to use for the gathering place, including institute buildings and meetinghouses. The building should have a designated space large enough for YSAs to gather for classes and activities. All gathering place locations must be approved by the Area Presidency. For the YSA Gathering place to function properly, it is required that a committee be set up to oversee the gathering. The purpose of the committee includes facilitating day-to-day access to gathering place facilities, keeping a current calendar and schedule of classes, activities, and events associated with the gathering place and coordinating with the facility scheduler, mentoring YSAs in their personal development along the covenant path, and administering finances associated with food, supplies, and so on for the gathering place, with approval of the stake president.</p>

            <p> As part of the gathering place program, young single adults engage in wholesome activities that build their 
                physical strength. Typical of such activites is going for early morning jogging and having their aerobics 
                afterwards. They have a trainer/coach who is either a member of the church or someone hired as a resource
                person to see them through these activities. Occasionally, they organize football competitions amongst the 
                various branches in the district to make it even more fun and interactive. The goal is that "all the YSA should 
                gather to improve each other both physically and spiritually."
