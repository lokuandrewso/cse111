        <p> “And also, that he shall continue in writing and making a history of all the important things which he shall observe and know concerning my church;”
            “…… writing, copying, selecting, and obtaining all things which shall be for the good of the church, and for the rising generations that shall grow up on the land of Zion, to possess it from generation to generation, forever and ever. Amen.” (D&C 69:3, 8)

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints; commonly referred to us LDS has many units in Ghana and for the sake of this site.
            I will talk about the units put together and called as a district in Kpong Ghana.</p>
