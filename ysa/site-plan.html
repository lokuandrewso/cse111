        all upcoming activites and various important informaton for the LDS Kpong Ghana district
     is stored. This site is needed to hold the history of events in the district so they are kept
     kept for Eternity for the world to see and know what's going on in Kpong</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target is all LDS members across the globe especially (those aged 18+ and single). 
        These are people who will be looking for ways to mingle and make commitments to 
        a partner for Eternity. They have limited access to members in other parts of the world

        LDS Kpong:
“And also, that he shall continue in writing and making a history of all the important things which he shall observe and know concerning my church;”
“…… writing, copying, selecting, and obtaining all things which shall be for the good of the church, and for the rising generations that shall grow up on the land of Zion, to possess it from generation to generation, forever and ever. Amen.” (D&C 69:3, 8)
“What will announce you is what you focus on”. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as part of its mandate to spread all over the world and take the Gospel of Jesus Christ to every son and daughter of God, has created many units across the world. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints; commonly referred to us LDS has many units in Ghana and for the sake of this site, I will talk about the units put together and called as a district in Kpong Ghana.
The total membership of Kpong Ghana District is 1,692, of which the average sacrament attendance as at the end of fourth quarter of 2022 was 617. Out of the total membership of 1,692, we have; 643 men and 609 women, with 181 young men and 136 young women. There were 1.064 households and 1,271 adults; of which 365 were Single Adults. 
Within the last twelve months, there were 128 recent converts. 
Coming to the site of “Kpong YSA”, one should be ready to learn about the history of LDS Kpong district and especially the YSA. Young Single Adults: simply abbreviated as YSA is a group of young individuals ages 18-30 years who are not legally married. 
This site focuses on the YSA of Kpong Ghana District and talks about their Gathering place program and all the fun trips organized by the leadership. Staying up to date with this site brings you all the current affairs in the district which are YSA related. You will also receive updates on all past and upcoming events organized by the YSA. 
The YSA Gathering place:
Young single adults and their friends love to gather and participate in wholesome activities and experiences that bring them closer to one another and to God. A gathering place is a designated location (in an existing meetinghouse or institute building) for young single adults and their friends to gather and participate in one or more activities such as; Religious education and gospel learning, Service and social activities, and Self-reliance and educational opportunities. 
For the YSA Gathering place to function properly, it is required that a committee be set up to oversee the gathering. The purpose of the committee includes facilitating day-to-day access to gathering place facilities, keeping a current calendar and schedule of classes, activities, and events associated with the gathering place and coordinating with the facility scheduler, mentoring YSAs in their personal development along the covenant path, and administering finances associated with food, supplies, and so on for the gathering place, with approval of the stake president.
YSA Trips.
As part of the gospel and not making things so boring for the younger groups, occasionally; trips are organized in the form of excursions for the YSA to travel and have fun by visiting tourist sites and sceneries. This puts the YSA in the spirit of unity as the saying goes; “Friends that travel together, stay together. 
Our main challenge as a District is unemployment and underemployment, especially among the Single Adults, this has led to increasing exodus of Single Adults to bigger towns and cities.

        A gathering place for young single adults (YSAs) is a designated location (in an existing meetinghouse or institute building) for YSAs and their friends to gather and participate in wholesome activities and experiences that will bring them closer to one another and to God. To get started, Identify buildings to use for the gathering place, including institute buildings and meetinghouses.
